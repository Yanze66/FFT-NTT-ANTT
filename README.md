# FFT-NTT-ANTT

Having been working on building different types of FFT/NNT/ANTT in various lengths on FPGA platform, I am doubt if it is correct the way nowaday people use to construct their accelerators. Reason is simple, most of the designs exaust their hardware resource but still struggle in a relatively low throughput (especially for long fft workload, such as 4096). Hence, I plan to build a repository to investigate how to achieve a highthroughput, arbitrary length FTT with little hardware resources.
