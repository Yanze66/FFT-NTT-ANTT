I built a high throughput acceleration for reed-solomon extention, which achieves 50 times speed up compared to python-based implementation (2s versus 97s). Currently I find a bubbld in 16k ANTT, which degrades the throughput from 10 Gb/s to 5 Gb/s, and I am doubting a deeper fifo can solve it. 

Pityfully, I have to switch to other tasks, like prepare slides for a conference, and do other experimental work. So I dont know whats the next time I look into this issue.
